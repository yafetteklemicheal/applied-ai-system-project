# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- [ ] Describe the game's purpose.

The purpuose of the game is to see if the user can guess the secret number before they run out of allowed attempts.

- [ ] Detail which bugs you found.

The first bug I found was that the hints were giving incorrect guidance to the user. 
The second bug I found was that the user could not use all available attempts and will lose the game with 1 attempt remaining.

- [ ] Explain what fixes you applied.

For the first bug, I reversed the hints so they guide the user properly.
For the second bug, I updated the logic of the code counting the users attempt so that it starts from 0 rather than 1.
